This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Some notes about the project

* I used a public proxy from Heroku to fetch the static data and avoid CORS issue
* The design on Figma covers only large screens; I adapted it for medium and small displays
* I only used the sun icon though some forecasts needed a different one; `Icons.js` makes easy to add svg icons and map them to the forecast
